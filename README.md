# Supporting Information: MAG-SOLex molecular representation: a methodology for handling complex molecules in algorithms
This repository is part of the Supporting Information of the article MAG-SOLex molecular representation: a methodology for handling complex molecules in algorithms by Diego Telles Fernandes, Karina Klock da Costa, Helton Siqueira Maciel, Radha Liliane Pinto GonÃ§alves and Dirceu Noriler.
This repository includes the following information:
- Calculation algorithm for properties using Joback groups and first-order Marrero & Gani groups contribution methods, including Tc, Pc, Vc, Tb, and Tm.
- Reaction network algorithm with two possible subsequent reactions: Aromatic ring saturation and dealkylation.

## Models
The models used consist of the following:
- For property calculations: identification of Joback and Marrero & Gani groups through the inspection of the SOLex and MAG matrices; addition of each contribution according to each method, as provided in the examples in the section Property calculations using group contribution methods in Application examples of the article.
- For reaction applications: the selection criteria for each reaction are identified, and when the molecule meets the conditions, the reaction is performed, generating the appropriate products with their corresponding SOLex and MAG matrices. The provided examples can be found in Chemical Reactions in Application examples of the article. We suggest examining Figure 10 for details.

## Usage instructions:
1.	Run the binary from the project's root folder using the command: bin/MAGSOLexExamples.
2.	To run the property example, use the -Properties flag, and for the reaction example, use the -Reactions flag.
    2.1 Properties flag: use this flag to run the Properties calculation algorithm, calculating the properties using group contribution methods with Joback and 1st-order Marrero and Gani.
  	2.2 Reactions flag: use this flag to run the Reaction calculations algorithm, applying, when possible, the two reaction rules described to the molecule under analysis.
3.	The provided examples are based on the article and can be modified as needed in: ./run/ExProperties and ./run/ExReactions. The terminal output for these example runs can be viewed in the files:
- [Property Example](https://github.com/pqgeunicamp/MAGSOLexArticle/blob/main/log_terminal_PropertyExample.log)
- [Reactions Example](https://github.com/pqgeunicamp/MAGSOLexArticle/blob/main/log_terminal_ReactionsExample.log)

## Folder structure
- *src*: Contains the source code files.
- *bin*: Contains the compiled binary for execution. In other words, run the makefile to compile the content of the src folder into the binary named redereac in the bin folder.
- *run*: Contains input or output files generated during execution.

## Prerequisites
1. Case 1 - Native Linux
1.1 Installing Linux
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential g++-12 libeigen3-dev
#!/bin/bash
```

1.2 Line to be added
```
LINE='export PATH="/usr/include/eigen3:$PATH"'
```

1.3 Check if the line already exists in .bashrc
```
grep -qxF "$LINE" ~/.bashrc || echo "$LINE" >> ~/.bashrc
```

2. Case 2 - DOCKER
```
docker build -t rede-reacional-lite .
docker run -it rede-reacional-lite
```
